            <p>A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.</p>
            <p>The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way.</p>
            <p>Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million (108) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (1014) stars,[3] each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.</p>

            <img src="media/stars.jpeg" alt="STARS"/>
            <p>A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. </p>
            <p>The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but due to their immense distance from Earth they appear as fixed points of light in the sky.</p>
            <p>The most prominent stars are grouped into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names
            <p>The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 to 1024 stars, but most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all individual stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.</p></p>

            <h2>GASES</h2>
            <img src="media/gases.jpeg" alt="GASES"/>
            <p>While hydrogen and helium make up most of the gases in interstellar space, tiny traces of other elements such as carbon, oxygen and iron also exist.</p>
            <p>You will find large amounts of complex gases such as methane and ammonia on gas planets such as Jupiter and Saturn</p>
            <p>Some of them were likely created within our galaxy.</p> 
            <p>As dying stars exploded, the gas was thrust away from the supernovas with enough speed to push it outside of the Milky Way, where it formed clouds.</p> 
            <p>These clouds rain back down on the galaxy, much like water from a fountain falls to the ground after jetting upward.</p>
